ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest project: MediBuddy â€“ Your AI-Powered Medical Assistant! ðŸ§ ðŸ’¬

Over the past few weeks, Iâ€™ve been building MediBuddy, a conversational AI chatbot designed to assist users with reliable medical insights â€“ powered by state-of-the-art language models and enriched with trusted data from The Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine ðŸ“˜.

ðŸ’¡ What is MediBuddy?
MediBuddy is a streamlit-based chatbot that allows users to ask medical questions and receive contextual answers based on verified medical literature. It's designed for education, preliminary awareness, and informational support â€” not as a replacement for doctors, but as a bridge to understanding health topics.

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack Overview
Frontend/UI: Streamlit â€“ lightweight and interactive chatbot interface

Data Source: The Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine (PDFs parsed and chunked for NLP)

Document Loading: Langchainâ€™s PyPDFLoader and DirectoryLoader

Text Chunking: RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

Embeddings: HuggingFaceEmbeddings using "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"

Vector Database: FAISS for fast, similarity-based search

LLM Integration: HuggingFaceEndpoint with "mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3"

Prompt Engineering: Custom PromptTemplate for medically-focused Q&A retrieval

Environment Management: .env and dotenv for token security

ðŸ§  Features
âœ… Natural-language medical Q&A
âœ… RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) pipeline for precise context-based responses
âœ… Indexed and searchable medical knowledge base
âœ… Modular, scalable, and open for continuous improvement

ðŸŽ¯ Why MediBuddy?
In an age where health misinformation is rampant, I wanted to build a tool that empowers people to explore health topics safely and accurately, backed by structured, medically-reviewed knowledge.

ðŸ“Œ Next Steps ðŸ”¹ Adding multilingual support
